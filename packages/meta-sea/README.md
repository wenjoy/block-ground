# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
GAS_REPORT=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts
```

# How to start
1. start local block chain with `npx hardhat node`
2. deployt contract `npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts`
3. start web server `npm run dev`
